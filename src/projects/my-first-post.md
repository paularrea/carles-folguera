resume: 'Static corporate website for a Wholesale supplier who is based on B2B business models on the Swiss market. Working closely with the IT team and the UX/UI designer we worked with Adobe XD for the design and creation of a prototype of the user experience for the site which has helped me to develop the project in a much faster, more comfortable and structured way.'
