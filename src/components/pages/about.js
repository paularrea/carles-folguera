        <span>beautiful</span> and intuitive <span>designs</span> that improves
        people's lives. My journey as a <span>freelance</span> developer
        started 2 years ago, since then, Iâ€™ve done <span>remote</span> work for different agencies and startups <span>creating</span> web products
        for both business and consumer use. While I'm not <span>coding</span> or
